This is my first python project. From the start I had an interest in GUIs, so as soon as I learnt the basics of tkinter I started working on this project.

### Making the layout of the calculator

In this calculator, a frame is used for making the screen, and two labels, one for putting digit buttons and the other for function keys are used. I used sub-labels inside these labels to put buttons on it

### Making the screen

Entry box is used for making the screen of the calculator

### Giving life to the buttons

Till this stage my claculator was completed, virtually, it was not functionable. I tried binding buttons to the functions but the results were printed on the console and not on the calculator's screen, so I tried using lambda in the buttons and it worked!

### Giving Midas touch to the calculator

I put this code in the __init__ function of the class calculator and gave it nice color combinatons to make it look more beautiful,and here it is!

P.S:- When you see my code, you'll find that I've commented out some part of my code, that's because I was trying to add one more button in the calculator 'delete' which would delete just the first digit from the right but when I'm trying it, it is throwing out some errors
So I will update it as soon as I find the solution

Feedback is welcomed!

Happy Coding :)
